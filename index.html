        <h2>Why Howard's?</h2>
        <p>Howard's Lakeside General Store has been a family-owned gem in the community for decades. Even with our recent change in management, our commitment to quality remains strong. We offer a wide range of services tailored to fishing enthusiasts, including professional respooling, live bait selection (from redworms to minnows), and cold bait options like shad and liver tubs.</p>
